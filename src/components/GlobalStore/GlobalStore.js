      <p className='para'>MG-DripStore started off as a fun clone of Nykaa Fashionâ€”just for a project and to test my skills. I coulddnt stop there. I kept tweaking, changing layouts, playing with designs, fixing bugs, and slowly it became something of my own.<br></br><br></br>

Its not just a dummy site. The database works, the products load, cart functions are real, and everythings connected and functional. Sure, you cant place actual orders yet !ðŸ˜…, but this site gives a feel of how a full-blown fashion store works behind the scenes.<br></br><br></br>

Honestly? I had a greate experience building this. Its one of those projects where I kept trying "this and that"â€”some worked, some didnt, but all of it taught me a lot. And hey, maybe one day if life throws me a good surprise, this might even go live for real. Never say never, right?<br></br><br></br>

ðŸ‘‰ And make sure to check out the About the Developer page too. Its got a bit more of my story.<br></br>

Thanks for reading it all &#41; </p>
